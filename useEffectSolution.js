To solve this, add error handling within the cleanup function:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAsyncOperation().subscribe(data => {
    // ... handle data
  });

  return () => {
    try {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error during cleanup:', error);
      // Optionally, add more sophisticated error handling here (e.g., reporting, fallback logic)
    }
  };
}, []);
```

This improved version uses a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle any errors that might occur during the cleanup process.  The error is logged to the console, allowing for easier debugging and preventing the application from crashing.  Consider more robust error handling strategies like error reporting for production applications.
